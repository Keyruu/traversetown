      <p>I'm a full stack developer / devops engineer and musician from Germany. I also love design and smart home.</p>
      <p>I love to expirement with different web development stacks and implement them in hobby projects.</p>
      <p>This website is a demo of the stack and for implementing fun little features I think of.</p>
      <p>It's also a place for me to share my music and other stuff I like.</p>
      <p>Feel free to contact me via <a class="text-blue-700 hover:underline" href="mailto:keyruu@web.de" target="_blank">email</a>.</p>
      <p><br/>This site does not need an Imprint, because it is a purely personal site without any commercial purpose.</p>
